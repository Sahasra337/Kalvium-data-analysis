# Kalvium-data-analysis

This Data analysis project is created by performing Web Scraping using python from the website 'https://results.eci.gov.in'
After obtaining a particular excel file having the data of parties and the number of constituencies they have won. Using QlikSense Platform, I have created various visualizations like pie chart, gauge chart, with filters. The NL insights have been obtained. Finally, slides of stories are created with the option of storytelling in QlikSense.
